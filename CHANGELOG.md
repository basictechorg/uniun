# Changelog

All notable changes to UNIUN are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
The `+build` suffix on each version (e.g. `1.1.0+2`) is the Android `versionCode` /
iOS build number — it increases by **1 on every store upload**, even if the user-facing
version is unchanged.

See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the full release procedure, and
[docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md) for the technical engineering detail behind each release —
what was actually verified, what broke, and what's still open — that doesn't belong in a
user-facing changelog.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-08-13

A reliability-focused release for Shiv, Nataraj, and Ganas — plus QR sign-in for the
web and automatic on-device storage cleanup.

### Added
- **QR sign-in for the web.** Approve a browser login by scanning a QR code from a phone
  that's already signed in — no password, no key to paste.
- **Leftover model file cleanup.** The model picker can now detect and remove stray or
  partial model files left behind by an interrupted download or an earlier app version,
  reclaiming storage that was previously invisible to the app.
- **Ganas can now run on a UNIUN Cloud model**, pinned per-agent independently of
  whichever model the rest of the app is using — in both the foreground and while the
  app is closed in the background (#162).

### Changed
- **Onboarding interest picker now loads its list from UNIUN's backend**, so new
  suggested accounts can be added without an app update. Shows a proper loading/retry
  state instead of a fixed in-app list.
- **Model selection is now one consistent picker used everywhere** — Shiv chat,
  Nataraj, and Gana previously each had their own different, inconsistent model
  picker; there's now a single shared sheet across all three (#158, #161).
- Updated the on-device AI engine (`flutter_gemma`) to the latest version for improved
  reliability under sustained use (#149).

### Fixed
- **Model pickers (Shiv chat, Gana) were showing a model's internal routing id to
  users** — now only ever show the friendly display name.
- **Nataraj could show a misleading "AI model couldn't run on this device" error**
  even when the model was working fine and simply didn't come up with a usable idea
  for one note combination — now shows an honest "no idea this time, try again"
  message instead.
- **Switching your on-device AI model didn't always take effect immediately** —
  the app could keep quietly generating with the old model until restarted (#160).
- **Switching or deleting an AI model while a chat or idea generation was still in
  progress could cause errors.** Model changes now wait for or safely interrupt
  in-progress generation instead of racing it (#167).
- **Ganas with no specific model pinned now correctly follow whichever AI backend
  (on-device or cloud) is currently active** — previously they always assumed
  on-device and would silently do nothing if cloud was selected.
- **Cloud-based idea and agent generation could occasionally hang indefinitely, or
  fail without a clear error, when two requests overlapped** — fixed (#166).
- **Empty, abandoned Shiv conversations no longer clutter your chat history** (#159).
- **Leaving a Shiv chat while the AI was still replying no longer leaves a
  permanently blank response** — whatever had been generated (or a note that it was
  interrupted) is saved when you come back.
- A small accuracy improvement to Shiv's on-device knowledge-graph search: it could
  occasionally count the same connection twice, using up a slot that could have
  surfaced a genuinely new one (#144).

## [2.2.0] — 2026-08-02

This release expands UNIUN's inference, identity, and offline networking capabilities.

### Added
- **UNIUN cloud inference.** Use hosted AI models from Shiv with built-in model selection,
  credit usage, and mobile payment support alongside on-device inference.
- **QR identity recovery.** Sign in on another device by scanning a secure QR code instead of
  manually transferring identity credentials.
- **Offline mesh sync.** Nearby devices can discover each other over local transports and securely
  synchronize notes, follows, groups, Manas collections, Ganas, and other user-owned data.
- **Surrounding notes.** Discover notes shared by nearby mesh peers in a dedicated feed.

### Changed
- Onboarding interest recommendations are now loaded from UNIUN's service so suggested accounts
  can be updated without an app release.
- Expanded repository, gateway, mesh, and integration test coverage.

### Fixed
- Improved cloud-model selection, credit accounting, inference UI, login, and sync reliability.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-03

A follow-up release focused on **theming**, **reliability of the followed-notes badge**, and a
significant expansion of the test suite.

### Added
- **Dark mode.** Full dark theme across every screen and component, with a new theme system built
  on `AppCustomColors` and a `ThemeCubit`. A **theme-mode setting** (System / Light / Dark) is
  available in Settings and persists across launches via `AppSettingsStore`. All shared widgets —
  note cards, composer, floating nav, QR views, thread views, drop indicators, media views, etc. —
  were updated to use theme-aware colors instead of hard-coded values.
- **Broader test coverage.** New tests for the theme system (`AppThemeMode`, `ThemeCubit`, theme-mode
  persistence, Settings theme row), the media pipeline (`BlossomClient`, `MediaCacheDataSource`,
  `MediaRepositoryImpl`, media use cases, gallery/detail cubits, media tile & settings row, and an
  end-to-end media pipeline integration test), and additional common-layer tests.

### Changed
- **Followed-notes badge is now derived from unread rows.** The unread-reference indicator on
  followed notes is computed directly from the unread rows rather than a cached counter, so the
  badge stays consistent with what the user actually sees.

### Fixed
- CI pipeline fix.
- Blossom media-upload failure path hardened, with matching backend `DEPLOY.md` guidance.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-30

A major release: the public **Channels** feature is now **Groups**, the app gets a visual
redesign, and UNIUN goes **multilingual** with full Hindi support.

### Added
- **Multi-language support — English + Hindi.** UNIUN can now run fully in **Hindi** (हिन्दी,
  Devanagari). An in-app language switcher is available on the welcome screen (a quick EN / हिन्दी
  toggle), on a dedicated **language-selection page**, and in **Settings**; the choice persists
  across launches. Several more languages are listed as "coming soon". *(The Hindi translation is
  machine-generated and pending native-speaker review.)*
- **Onboarding interest picker.** After creating an identity, new users pick topics they care about;
  UNIUN batch-follows a set of house accounts in a single transaction (one Kind-3 contact-list
  republish) so the feed is alive from the first scroll instead of empty.
- **Reporting & content moderation (NIP-56).** Users can file **Kind 1984** reports on notes and
  users (nudity, spam, impersonation, illegal content, etc.), optionally block the author in the
  same step, and review their own report history. Reporting a note also tombstones it locally so it
  leaves the reporter's feed and threads.

### Changed
- **Channels are now "Groups".** The public-chat feature was renamed **Channel → Group** across the
  entire app — UI, all strings, and the codebase — while preserving existing on-device data.
  ("Group ID" terminology is kept where users copy/share identifiers.)
- **Redesigned application.** A broad visual refresh across the app's screens and components.
- **Smarter on-device AI scheduling.** Improvements to the inference scheduler that arbitrates chat,
  foreground, knowledge-extraction, and background (Gana / Nataraj) AI work so the device stays
  responsive under contention.
- **Apple App Store compliance.** Edit-profile, Gana, and header fixes plus the other changes
  required to pass App Store review; the companion website was shipped.

### Fixed
- Direct thread replies that were missing their NIP-10 reply marker.
- Shiv UI not refreshing in some states.
- Draft deep-link handling.
- Assorted bug fixes and background-worker stability improvements.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Manas — scoped note collections.** Users can group their notes into named **Manas** and use
  them to scope where AI looks. Picking a Manas narrows Shiv's RAG retrieval, Gana's input pool,
  and the composer-chat context to just that collection (falling back to the whole library when
  none is selected). Manas search now includes drafts and the user's own notes.
- **Nataraj — AI swipe-deck idea generator.** A swipe deck that synthesizes 2–3 of the user's own
  notes into a single new note suggestion, reusing the on-device generation substrate. Cards are a
  local cache, not Nostr events. (Shipped as "Manthan", renamed to **Nataraj** before release.)
- **Gana — autonomous AI agents.** User-owned agents that watch an input surface, infer over
  selected Manas(es), and autonomously publish. Includes scheduled/background generation
  (own isolate + own Isar) and a foreground engine. The trigger config was collapsed into a single
  **"When should this run?"** preset radio (five presets covering the trigger matrix).
- **Composer-chat — inline AI in the composer.** Tap the avatar in any composer (thread / channel /
  DM / private channel) to pick a Manas and chat with an on-device model grounded in the surface's
  recent messages plus the selected Manas.
- **Embed-by-value note sharing with full-note composer.** The share sheet now carries the original
  note **by value** as a self-contained `embeddedNoteJson` snapshot (no `q`/`k`/`p` pointer, no Isar
  lookup, retention-immune) and lets the user author a full note — text, references, and images —
  alongside the embed. The snapshot's signature is verified once at inbound; failures render an
  "unverified" badge.
- **Receive shares from other apps into UNIUN.** UNIUN now registers as a system share target, so
  content shared from other apps lands in the composer.
- **DM replies.** Direct messages support replying to a specific message.
- **OpenRouter (cloud) LLM backend, opt-in.** A backend-agnostic `LlmRepository` now dispatches
  between the on-device `localGemma` runner and a remote **OpenRouter** backend; API keys are stored
  in `flutter_secure_storage` (Keychain / Keystore), never in Isar or SharedPreferences.
- **Media attachments in drafts + BlurHash placeholders** for smoother image loading.
- **"How it works" intro carousel** on the onboarding entry screen.
- **Reddit-style source attribution** shown in Shiv answers.
- **Configurable recent-sync window.** History sync from relays can be capped to a configurable
  recent window to limit how far back the Gateway pulls.
- **Dockerized backend.** The Go relay (`uniun-backend/`) now ships with a Docker setup for
  reproducible deployment.

### Changed
- **On-device AI generation moved to the main isolate** (off the dedicated isolate) for the
  foreground path, with a UI performance pass across onboarding and the feed.
- **Per-user cap on AI note generation** plus assorted generation-flow UI improvements.
- Removed the color picker from Manas.
- Updated `flutter_gemma`.

### Fixed
- Shiv: sanitize the live-streaming message bubble and anchor the Shiv persona near the question.
- Guard against `add`/`emit` after BLoC close during long LLM generation (no more
  "emit after close" crashes on slow inference).
- Saved-note logic bugs.
- Manas search missing drafts and own notes.
- Background worker stability fixes.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Media support (images, video, files).** Notes, channel messages, DMs, and private-channel
  messages can now carry attachments. Uploads go through the **Blossom** content-addressed
  blob store (BUD-01), and each attachment is described on the event with a NIP-92 `imeta`
  tag. Attachments are stored on `NoteModel.attachments` and joined to on-device files by
  SHA-256 via `MediaCacheModel`.
- **Save media to device.** Media blobs referenced by a note can be downloaded and persisted
  to local storage; the gallery lets the user remove them again (user-driven, no automatic GC).
- **Markdown rendering** for note text.

### Changed
- **Redesigned welcome / front page.** The onboarding entry screen was reworked for a cleaner
  first-run experience. (Design spec: `docs/ui-ux/2026-06-17-welcome-screen-redesign-design.md`.)
- **Shiv (AI) ignores raw media.** The RAG pipeline no longer feeds media payloads into the
  model, so on-device inference stays focused on note text.
- General UI polish across the feed, media viewer, and back-button behaviour.

### Fixed
- DM and feed bugs — channel routing issue, feed/DM sync glitches, and assorted general bugs.
- DeepSeek R1 model failing to load/run.
- Production builds no longer upload debug logs.
